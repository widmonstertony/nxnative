# nxnative — iOS 16 / iOS 17 compatibility

**Nintendo Switch native execution for iPhone and iPad, including an iOS/iPadOS 16.1+ legacy Metal backend.** This is [widmonstertony's compatibility fork](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative). Its published fixes are on `main`; device work is also tracked on [`ios16-ios17-compat`](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/tree/ios16-ios17-compat). It retains the Metal 4 target for supported devices on iOS 26 or later.

Start with the **[iOS 16 / iOS 17 build and installation guide](docs/ios16-ios17.md)** and the **[device compatibility status](docs/fork-status.md)**. An older OS build target does not make every game compatible with every older GPU. The upstream gallery below includes Mac results and is not an iOS 16/17 compatibility list.

| Target | Minimum device OS | Renderer and scope |
|---|---|---|
| iOS 16 / iOS 17 compatibility | iOS / iPadOS **16.1** | Traditional Metal backend; strict per-game resource audit; A10X and M2 have different limits |
| Modern iPhone / iPad | iOS / iPadOS **26.0** | Explicit Metal 4 target; requires compatible hardware |
| Switch 2 | Per game and device | Targeted iPhone Air and M2 builds; see the play-test limits below |

The former branch name was `ios16-pokemon-za-port`; it was renamed, preserving its history. **Source builds are available; this repository does not distribute ready-to-play games or a universal compatibility guarantee.**

## TonTon Gamebox: game fixes and verification

Add each published game fix here with its affected device, what changed, and
the deepest scene actually verified. A signed install or a successful shader
build is not a gameplay pass. Keep earlier observations in the
[device history](docs/fork-status.md) and exact backports in the
[engine notes](dm/ios/Engines/NxNative/README.md).

Air build 60.61 defaults compatible native Switch games to handheld mode and
MetalFX spatial upscaling, with a per-game override. Handheld mode leaves the
render size to each game. The compatibility renderer now also has a classic
MetalFX path: local GPU validation covered both 1280×720 and 960×540 input,
including color and aspect-ratio bars. Deployment and game-by-game validation
of that renderer on iPad are pending.

| Game | What this fork changed | Verified result and open issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mario Kart World | Restored movie texture views, terrain uploads and sparse mappings; fixed black scenery with conditional clears; reduced upload and pipeline work; restored Air's 60 Hz pacing ([movie](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/3d0a3a0), [clears](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/381ed5f), [upload cache](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/e221694), [pacing](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/e847a4c)) | Air player confirmed the black scenery was gone, but reported low race performance and intermittent race-entry crashes. Air logs still show 1080p input to MetalFX even in handheld mode. On M2, free roam rendered in a prior test; mesh faults and race performance remain open. |
| Zelda: Ocarina of Time | Corrected opening movie decoding on Metal 3 and handled the offline play-report request that aborted at the end of the opening ([movie](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/4f25737), [M2](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/ed552f8), [Air](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/4ecd063)). A scoped [M2 native pacing patch](dm/ios/Engines/NxNative/README.md#ocarina-of-time-native-frame-pacing-m2-6090-candidate) prevents the game from inheriting uncapped 120 Hz presentation. | M2 60.62 reaches the save list, but loading the forest save still faults in a GPU render pass. The Air fix is installed; completion of the affected section has not been reverified by the player. The signed 60.90 pacing candidate still awaits installation and a gameplay timing check. |
| Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom | Restored missing shared-font assets; exposed a real 3D render-scale control and corrected the FPS overlay toggle for data-only games ([controls](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/86e676d), [overlay](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/acb19b6)) | Air player confirmed the game opened and later reported less stutter and no FPS overlay. Sustained 60 fps has not been verified. |
| Pokémon Violet | Restored the standard and extension shared fonts in the existing Air installation after the startup log reported that it could not open the standard font. Both files were read back and verified by SHA-256. | The post-font Air run loaded the font and then aborted while initializing the Pokémon GO Plus + Bluetooth service. The host now provides an offline accessory path. The signed build preserves the game frameworks; Air title entry still needs a player retest. |
| Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Switch 2 Edition | Filled missing Metal 3 shader variants and added a Metal 4 compute archive path ([shader loading](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/2d1396b), [pipeline cache](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/d24d7c2)) | M2 loaded a save and rendered an interior. Neither sustained city performance nor all later scenes are certified. |
| Pokémon Pokopia | Restored missing graphics libraries and fixed Switch 2 virtual microphone enumeration ([service fix](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/646c4ab)) | Reached gameplay in device testing; the player reported character-preview rendering defects on Air and M2. |
| The Witcher 3 | Repaired Air startup after tracing the executable's address-space reservation; verified the exact installed framework ([Air repair](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/33b0df4)) | Air player confirmed title/game entry. M2 character materials still render incorrectly in some scenes. |
| Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 | Fixed the OpenGL ES startup path, framebuffer queries, and NVN/GL texture and fence sharing ([startup](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/f691081), [framebuffer](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/2eddd56), [texture sharing](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/175301f)) | Air player reached battle on one build. Later reports of black characters and another battle-entry crash are still open. |
| Fate visual novels | Repaired native OpenGL framebuffer entry points needed during story initialization ([framebuffer aliases](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/845c721)) | Air player verified both title screens display at the correct size and Hollow Ataraxia can enter the story. This does not cover the rest of each title. |
| Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | Fixed initial texture content, race button mapping, audio buffering and elapsed game time ([textures](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/ffed898), [input and audio](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/16cecc6), [timing](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/d59fd00)) | Device gameplay confirmed; no long race performance guarantee. |
| GTA V | Uses the Gamebox mode picker with the separate native iPadOS 16 engine ([mode picker](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/421e5cd)) | Air player confirmed gameplay and access to per-game settings. |
| Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge | Added native entry and touch controls: tap for left click, drag to select, two-finger tap for right click ([touch](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/3cd0d50)) | Old iPad testing confirmed map interaction in the original app. The updated signed Gamebox on that device requires the retail-resource restoration before it can be retested. |

Library changes include [private CloudKit save transport](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/4fe54cb),
[independent game engines](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/2798a14),
[verified single-file shader images](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/b51852e),
and [Air game-paced presentation](https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative/commit/75f30d7).
CloudKit cross-platform delivery is tracked separately from code integration:
the Mac and Apple TV builds must use the same private container and environment
as the mobile builds, and live save exchange on those devices remains to be verified.

Play your own Nintendo Switch games natively on iPhone and iPad. Bring your game (its NSP files) and your `prod.keys`; one script turns them into an IPA that you sideload.

It is not an emulator: the game's own code runs directly on the Apple chip, with Switch graphics rebuilt on Metal. Nothing from any game is in this repository, and the project is not affiliated with Nintendo or any game publisher.

Switch 2 games have started too: [Donkey Kong Bananza](dm/games/040074A01BF12000/README.md) plays on the Mac, packed from a dump of the game; iPhone and iPad are untested.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built on other people's work ([licenses](dm/third_party/README.md)):

- **[d2r-mobile](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile)** (MIT) developed this native-execution approach, for Diablo II: Resurrected. nxnative started as a copy of its generic parts: the NSO rewriter, the host that stands in for Horizon, the NVN-on-Metal layer and the iOS app shell. Fixes go both ways.
- **Ryujinx** (MIT): its shader translator (`Ryujinx.Graphics.Shader`, `Ryujinx.Common` and `Spv.Generator` 1.3.2, in `dm/third_party/ryujinx` with a few fixes listed in [its README](dm/third_party/ryujinx/README.md)) turns the games' shaders into SPIR-V. Its emulation of the kernel and system services is also a reference when the host's behaviour is in doubt.
- **[Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)**: its kernel, mesosphère, is the reference for Horizon's synchronization semantics (address arbiter, condition variables).
- **[LibHac](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac)**: reads NSPs and layers updates over the base game in `dm/tools/nx_extract`.
- **[SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross)**: SPIR-V to Metal Shading Language.
- **[glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)** compiles the GLSL of OpenGL games to SPIR-V for it.
- **[MacNativeGames](https://github.com/ly05010419/MacNativeGames)** (MIT): the GPU widening of 8-bit indices and in-pass clears in `dm/gfx/nvn/nvn_mtl.m`, and the visibility-counter lowering in the shader translator.

## How to play

Switch 2 games are built from a folder of their files, not from NSPs, and are tested on the Mac only: see [Switch 2 games](#switch-2-games).

### With a Mac app

Community projects build on nxnative with Mac apps that turn your games into apps for your iPhone, iPad or Mac, with no command line, and keep them in a library. They are separate projects: questions and bugs about them go to their own pages.

- [NX2Apple](https://github.com/LNPANDY/NX2Apple)
- [NX Play](https://github.com/varyform/nx-native-wrapper)
- [NxNative Launcher](https://github.com/rennan101/nxnative_Launcher)
- [LumaNX](https://github.com/Xc1Ym/LumaNX)

### Build from the command line

You need a Mac with macOS 26.6 or later, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode%2027.2) 27.2, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and Python 3.12 or newer (an arm64 one, not an Intel Homebrew's). An iPhone build also needs Xcode's iOS platform (Xcode → Settings → Components).

The shaders are built with Xcode 27.2's Metal compiler. Select it before step 1: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`. With several Xcode versions installed, name this one `Xcode-27.2.app` and select it with `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-27.2.app`.

**1. Install the tools** (only once), in Terminal:

```
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
git clone --branch ios16-ios17-compat https://github.com/widmonstertony/nxnative.git
cd nxnative
brew install xcodegen zstd glslang
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
python3 -m pip install lz4 "capstone>=5,<6" fonttools nsz zbic "backports.zstd; python_version < '3.14'"
```

**2. Put your game in a folder**: the game, plus its update and DLC if you have them (`.nsp`, `.xci`, `.nsz` or `.xcz`):

```
~/Games/MarioWonder/
  Super Mario Bros. Wonder [010015100B514000][v0].nsp
  Super Mario Bros. Wonder [010015100B514800][v327680].nsp
```

**3. Build**, with your game folder and your `prod.keys`:

```
DM_IOS_RENDERER=legacy DM_LEGACY_TARGET=a10x \
  python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/MarioWonder -k ~/keys/prod.keys --gpu none
```

For the tested M2 iPad capability target, use `DM_LEGACY_TARGET=m2`; do not select it for A10X. For a modern build, select `DM_IOS_RENDERER=metal4` explicitly. See the [compatibility guide](docs/ios16-ios17.md) before choosing a target.

The IPA appears in the game's folder only after all build and resource checks pass. Allow at least twice the game's size plus 10 GB of free build space; large shader sets can take several hours. Building again can reuse matching caches.

To play on the Mac instead, add `--platform mac-app`: you get a Mac app of the game to open from Finder. All options: [The packing script in detail](docs/development.md#the-packing-script-in-detail).

### Install

Install the IPA on your iPhone or iPad with a sideloading tool such as AltStore, Sideloadly or LiveContainer. If your tool offers **Increased Memory Limit**, turn it on: the bigger games need it.

Game too big to install? Build again with `--romfs separate`, and run the command the script prints once to copy the game files to your phone ([Quick reinstalls](docs/development.md#quick-reinstalls)).

Controls, saves and settings: [Playing](docs/playing.md).

### Switch 2 games

A Switch 2 game is built from a folder of its files, not from NSPs, and needs no `prod.keys`. The script expects this folder (`updates` and `dlc` are optional):

```
~/Games/DonkeyKongBananza/
  base/exefs/                     main, main.npdm, sdk, rtld
  base/romfs/
  updates/458752/exefs/           the update's version, as a decimal number
  updates/458752/romfs/           the patched RomFS, not a patch
  dlc/040074a01bf13001/0/romfs/   the DLC's title ID
```

```
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py ~/Games/DonkeyKongBananza --platform mac-app
```

You get a Mac app, with no icon because the folder holds none. iPhone and iPad are untested.

## Games

Upstream games tested on Mac or iPhone; these results do not certify the legacy target. See the [fork device status](docs/fork-status.md) and the [per-game notes](dm/games/README.md#games) for tested platforms, progress and known issues:

The upstream modern path targets iOS / iPadOS 26 or later and compatible hardware. This fork additionally builds for iOS / iPadOS 16.1 and 17 with a separate legacy backend, BC texture handling and verified shader companions. Layered rendering, sampler limits and image atomics still restrict individual games on older GPUs. A provisional IPA for an unregistered game may not start.

- **Pokémon Violet, legacy iPad:** the shader translator and runtime now accept the read-only border colour block and its matching sampler in the fragment shader that performs an unsigned image atomic max. The original shader compiled for iPadOS 16.1 and its bindings passed the runtime parser on Mac. Device installation and gameplay verification for this change are still pending.

Under a game, "60 fps with 1.2.0" means it runs at 60 fps (30 on the Switch) with that update.
