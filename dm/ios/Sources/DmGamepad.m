// Virtual gamepad (Nintendo button positions) + physical controllers (GameController), handed to the host through dm_input_set and dm_pad_set_player (hle_hid.c, bit layout in dm_input.h).
//   Two layouts, three in handheld mode, picked in the in-game menu (GameMenu.swift) that the menu button at the top centre (a gear) opens; the choice is kept in NSUserDefaults (each game is its own app, so per game); the first launch uses the game profile's pad_layout (DM_GAME_PAD_LAYOUT).
//   The menu button hides when a physical controller is in use and the picture is on a TV. On the device screen it fades out after 3 idle seconds while a physical controller is in use and returns for 3 seconds on any screen touch. Its last item quits the game
//     (a prompt, front_ios.m), and so does holding a controller's Home button for 2 seconds.
//   Tap (touch): no control but the menu button, every other touch goes to the game's local touch viewport; offered only while the game is in handheld mode, the only one in which it reads the touch screen (Balatro, played by touch).
//   2D (simple): top corners ZL above L (one column), ZR above R likewise, teardrops with the tip toward the screen corner; − and + side by side at the top centre; the left stick in the bottom-left corner (fixed ring, tilt measured from the ring centre, small dead zone);
//     the A (right) B (bottom) X (top) Y (left) diamond in the bottom-right corner, sliding a finger between keys switches keys. Each bottom corner holds a single control, so it sits close in (reaching halfway into the side safe-area inset).
//   3D (full, Pro Controller style): everything in 2D (left stick and diamond keep their place and size), plus a D-pad (inward of and below the left stick, 8-way), a right stick that is not drawn
//     (a touch landing in the right third of the screen on no control holds it: centred where it lands, the centre dragged along once the finger passes the stick radius) and L3 / R3 (small round keys in the top row, inward of ZL / ZR).
//     Breath of the Wild crouches with L3 and uses the scope with R3; 3D World and Breath of the Wild turn the camera with the right stick.
//     The first time the 3D layout shows in a launch, a few words (DM_TOUCH_HINT) say where the undrawn right stick is, for two seconds; see "The right-stick hint".
//   Touch-down ownership (dm_pad_menu_takes and dm_pad_hit in DmPadGeometry.h): the menu button where it is nearer than a locked key (a view of its own, DmMenuButton), locked keys next (shoulders, − / +, L3 / R3), then whichever of the diamond, the D-pad and the left stick has the smallest distance / grab radius (the left stick's grab circle borders the D-pad),
//     then in 3D the right stick for a touch in the right third.
//   The player can move single controls in the shell's settings (DM_TOUCH_LAYOUT, one arrangement per layout): the geometry places each only where it fits and keeps the rest where they were.
//   Everything hugs the edges and corners to leave the picture room; controls sit over the picture, one CAShapeLayer each: a press only swaps the fill, a stick only moves its knob, nothing redraws the whole screen.
//   Where each control sits is DmPadGeometry.h (pure, tested on the Mac); the player picks the size there through DM_TOUCH_SIZE (small, medium, large; a size that does not fit the screen moves toward medium) and the left stick's place through DM_TOUCH_STICK (corner, higher, inward).
//   Touches no control takes (in 3D, those outside the right third) go to the game's touch screen when DmLayout assigns a local game viewport (pushGame; Super Mario Galaxy's pointer in handheld mode).
//   The touch sticks and keys hide while a physical controller is connected and return when it is removed. Unclaimed touches go to the game only when a local game viewport exists. Physical controllers keep every button (D-pad and right stick included) and map by position: bottom = B, right = A, left = Y, top = X (same positions as on a Switch controller); a Nintendo pad maps by its labels (pad_apple.h).
//   Each physical controller is a player of its own (local co-op), as on the Mac: the first one connected is player 1, together with the touch gamepad, the next player 2, and so on up to 8; see "Physical controllers" below.
//   Shaking the phone shakes the controller (DM_BTN_SHAKE: its six-axis sensor, hle_hid.c), whichever controls are in use; see "Shaking the phone" below.

// into the Switch frame for the screen's orientation (motion_phone_to_switch, motion_fusion.h): x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player.
// The host keeps phone and controller orientations separately, choosing fresh controller data in auto mode and the phone alone in forced mode.

// them in that view's frame for whichever display shows it and however it is turned: x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player, the Switch frame as it is.
// Before that they come in the hardware frame, turned here by the interface orientation, which holds only where the hardware frame is the screen's portrait frame: not on iPhone
